<blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size:0.9em;">The author of “Beyond the Wall,” “Whispering Wires,”
and “Peterman’s Luck” is at his best in this fascinating
story of underworld life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the _argot_ of the underworld, Chester Fay, alias Edward Letchmere,
an expert on other people’s strong-boxes, had lammistered to Short
Hills, California, where an excellent golf-links surrounds a
half-hotel, half-clubhouse of the superior order.</p>
<p>After finishing a game, upon the twelfth day of his stay at Short
Hills, Fay tossed his golf-bag to the turf, dismissed his caddy and sat
down at the Nineteenth Hole, where refreshments were at that time
available.</p>
<p>The girl who entered his life, a few minutes after he was seated, came
diagonally from the clubhouse. He mentally concluded that she had been
waiting on the porch for the game to finish.</p>
<p>She wore a picture-hat, carried a parasol and was extremely cool, as
was attested by her manner as she drew a chair up to his table and
said:</p>
<p>“I’m Charlie Laurie’s only daughter.”</p>
<p>Had the California sky fallen upon the links, Fay would not have been
more surprised. Charlie Laurie was serving fifty years in the Isolation
Section of Dannemora for the crime, committed against the dignity of
New York State, of forcing open a national bank, seizing the contents
of the vault and escaping to Argentina, where he was later turned up by
a former pal.</p>
<p>This man, as Fay recalled him in that long minute of his stare across
the table, was bulky, rough-voiced and disfigured by a giant scar which
ran from the lobe of his right ear down to, and under, his chin. The
girl who now professed to be his daughter resembled him in no
particular.</p>
<p>“Some mistake,” Fay said, rising gallantly. “I’m sure that you have
taken me for some one else.”</p>
<p>The girl lifted her elbows from the table, opened her parasol, raised
it and asked:</p>
<p>“Wont you sit down? I haven’t mistaken you for some one else. You are
Chester Fay, alias Edward Letchmere—an old friend of my father’s.”</p>
<p>Fay took off his plaid cap and sat down. He fingered a
platinum-and-gold cigarette-case, removed a monogrammed cigarette,
scratched a match on the bottom of the table and inhaled a deep breath
of Turkish-scented smoke.</p>
<p>“By what other name was your father known?” he tested her.</p>
<p>“He was sometimes called ‘Big Scar’!”</p>
<p>“Where were you born?”</p>
<p>“In Chi. I was with Micky Gleason’s mob in Paris. I worked deep-sea
with Minnie May, ‘The Duchess.’ I have been trained by my father to
dip, forge, stall for pennyweighting and ever so many useful things.”</p>
<p>“You don’t look it!” Fay exclaimed. “Upon my word I don’t believe
you’re Charlie Laurie’s daughter. Why, he is hardly your kind—at all.”</p>
<p>“Laying aside compliments, Mr. Fay, and how I found where you were here
in California and—so many things that take up time, I’ve got a
proposition to make which should be mutually advantageous. In other
words you are the only man in the world I would let in on a great, big
job.”</p>
<p>Fay removed his cigarette from his mouth and eyed the ashes. He ran his
slender fingers through his prematurely gray hair. His face lighted
with retrospection.</p>
<p>“Go on Miss—”</p>
<p>“Saidee Isaacs, they call me, although you know my name is Saidee
Laurie.”</p>
<p>“Proceed, Miss Isaacs, with your plan.”</p>
<p>The girl’s olive-shaped and tinted eyes swept the golf-links. She
brushed back a lock of sherry-colored hair.</p>
<p>“I’m going to help you crack a safe,” she informed him, “The safe—or
goopher, as Father would call it—is in the brokerage office of Frank
Robertson Pope, otherwise known in California get-rich-quick circles as
‘The Black Cougar.’”</p>
<p>Fay crushed his cigarette. A film dropped over his eyes. His lips
hardened to a straight line.</p>
<p>“Go on,” he said.</p>
<p>“You know the man?”</p>
<p>“I know him!”</p>
<p>“He deserves no mercy?”</p>
<p>“None.”</p>
<p>“He is a disgrace to all the good crooks in the world—a coward and a
hypocrite. He has served time—for usury. He got out of San Quentin by
squealing on his pals. He is trimming suckers right and left. He makes
suicides of widows. He fills the poorhouses. He is within the law—but
far guiltier than you or I.”</p>
<p>Fay realized that he faced a very well-informed young woman. He
moistened his lips and gazed over the golf-links. No one was within
driving distance of the Nineteenth Hole.</p>
<p>“Briefly,” he suggested, “you believe me to be Chester Fay, an old
friend of your father’s. You located this Chester Fay through the
underworld. You want him to help you turn off a trick on ‘The Black
Cougar.’ What would there be in it for him if this trick were
successfully turned?”</p>
<p>“One hundred thousand for him and the same for me.”</p>
<p>“How is the goopher protected?”</p>
<p>“By every known electrical device. It is in the back of his office. It
consists of three layers of vanadium steel and two layers of
fireproofing. The circular door has two dials and a time-lock. The
inner door has one dial. The day door has a flat-key lock.”</p>
<p>“What is above the vault?”</p>
<p>“A photograph studio.”</p>
<p>“What is in the basement?”</p>
<p>“The basement is occupied by a cigar-store. It doesn’t close until
twelve o’clock. There’s a pool-room in the back. Sometimes men play
poker there all night.”</p>
<p>“How many watchmen in the building?”</p>
<p>“One, employed by ‘The Black Cougar.’ He can’t be bought. I’ve tried.”</p>
<p>“The regular thing, then—watchman, electric protection, standard vault
built by Seaber, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“No—by Terryton!”</p>
<p>“A good box, but soft on top.”</p>
<p>The girl tilted her parasol so that her face was in a shadow.</p>
<p>“Are you game?” she asked.</p>
<p>“The proposition strikes me as being peculiar. Suppose I am Chester
Fay. How do I know that you are Charlie Laurie’s daughter?”</p>
<p>“Would this convince you?” The girl reached in her breast and laid a
folded photograph on the table. Fay picked it up. It was a good
likeness taken in a rogues’ gallery. A tag with a number was about the
girl’s neck. Her eyes were straight before her. Beneath the card was
the notation:</p>
<p>“Saidee Laurie, _alias_ Saidee Isaacs, _alias_ English Kitty.
Shoplifter, gun-moll, con-woman, gay-cat for Continental mobs of
safe-blowers and card-sharpers. Sentences, suspended each instance:
Auburn, N. Y., Rochester Workhouse, Rochester, N. Y., Bridewell,
Chicago, Ill.”</p>
<p>Fay turned the card over, then handed it back.</p>
<p>“Rather convincing,” he said. “Frankly, you don’t look it.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to help me?”</p>
<p>Fay traced circles on the iron table-top. He stared at his golf-bag. He
considered the situation from a score of angles. The thing that swayed
him and inclined him toward the proposition was the fact that “The
Black Cougar” was fair game for any self-respecting crook.</p>
<p>“I make one stipulation,” he said, finally. “Buy out the photograph
gallery and establish yourself above the vault. I’ll advance the
money.”</p>
<p>“I have the money. I had already figured on that,” was the girl’s
reply.</p>
<p>“You seem to have thought of most things. Do you know that if that
vault is taken by either an electric-arc or an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe,
I will be suspected?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think of that.”</p>
<p>“It is a fact! You see the police and the private agencies know a man
by his work. How can we take that vault in a new way? How can I go
through three layers of vanadium steel?”</p>
<p>“Has it ever been done?”</p><p>“Yes, by the introduction of graduated blasts of nitroglycerin.”</p>
<p>“Father would have opened the safe that way.”</p>
<p>“Your father was of the old school. The presence of a watchman, the
poker-players in the basement, the natural suspicion which ‘The Black
Cougar’ will have concerning his ill-gotten gains, calls for a new
idea—one that will be effective and noiseless. Can you think of a
way?”</p>
<p>“No. That’s why I came to see you.”</p>
<p>Fay crossed his legs and leaned away from the table. The girl’s face
was still in the shadow cast by her parasol. Again the thought came to
him that the whole proposition was a trick. Perhaps she was a tool in
the employ of “The Black Cougar.” Perhaps the police had sent her to
Short Hills in order to arrange a trap. He dismissed this thought,
however. The police of Los Angeles would have been anxious to make a
quick arrest. The price on his head amounted to five figures.</p>
<p>“I’ll chance you!” he said. “The only motive I see for your actions is
the one you’ve explained. You want to rob a robber—cheat a cheater.
Frank Robertson Pope, which is only one of ‘The Black Cougar’s’ names,
has amassed too much money, in too rotten a way. I understand he has
the longest and most complete sucker-list of any bucket-shop broker in
this country.”</p>
<p>“We can steal that and sell it.”</p>
<p>“There are people who would buy it?”</p>
<p>“I know a very well-known firm in New York and Washington that would
pay fifty thousand dollars for the list.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps that is all Pope has in the vault?”</p>
<p>The girl dropped her parasol to the turf, rose, leaned over the table
and said:</p>
<p>“If that _were_ all, would you still be game enough to try it?”</p>
<p>Fay stood erect. He pulled on his cap, pocketed his cigarette-case and
smiled down at Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>“After thinking the matter over—I will do anything in my power to beat
‘The Black Cougar.’ He is within the law and you and I are outside the
law. But I’ll take my chances against his, on Judgment Day.”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs thrust out an impulsive hand.</p>
<p>“I like you immensely for saying that, Chester Fay. I knew I’d like
you—from what Father told me. You see I visited him when I was East,
last week. He gave me directions how to find you here at Short Hills.”</p>
<p>Fay recalled a letter which he had written to Charlie Laurie. In it had
been a code telling where to send an answer. There was very little
danger in doing this, for prison guards were notoriously stupid.</p>
<p>“That explains everything I wanted to know,” he said. “You had better
hurry to Los Angeles and secure that studio.”</p><p>“I’ve already looked it over. I can buy all of the fixtures and assume
the lease. I’ll set up a Miss Sorjoni, Photographer of Children. You’ll
have until day-after-tomorrow to find out a way to cut down through the
vault.”</p>
